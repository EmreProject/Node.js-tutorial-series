The --save flag saves the cities package as a dependency for this project. Check your
package.json file now to see how the package is listed under dependencies. Because your
node_modules folder will grow, I recommend that you donâ€™t include it when you share
the project code online. Anyone who downloads the project, however, can enter npm
install to automatically install all the project dependencies listed in this file.
